All work that is done in class!

I am majoring in computer science. I have gained computer experience whether it was through school or past internships/job opportunities. The courses that I have taken were CS1 and CS2 and introductory elective courses like Visual Programming and Web Page Design. In past jobs or internships, I have worked on some projects and programs using the following languages: Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For example, I worked on a responsive website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. I also collaborated on a project that essentially was a calculator that used Python. I like to say that I have a sufficient amount of computer experience working with several languages. 

I believe that what we learn in this course would not only be useful but I think it’s always important to learn something new. As a computer science major, you’re always learning or obtaining new information. I believe that what we learn in this course would be helpful in my career and it is most likely I’ll need the skills from this course in my job. I think it’s also beneficial and looks great to have these skills when applying for jobs and would look great in the eyes of the companies hiring. One of my career goals is to program projects or programs and there is a possibility that an app could be that. That is why I think I would see myself using what we learn in this course.
